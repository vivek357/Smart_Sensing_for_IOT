    "    <p>GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) today includes a variety of satellite constellations, including the GPS (American, global), GLONASS (Russian, global), BeiDou (Chinese, global), Galileo (European, global), NavIC (Indian, regional) and QZSS (Japanese, regional). Depending on your smartphone’s hardware capabilities, you can tap into signals from such constellations and update your location. Google provides an array of open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gps-measurement-tools\">tools</a> for performing GNSS-related measurements on commodity Android smartphones and analyzing such datasets.</p>\n",

Ensure the location permissions are provided to this app, and you have turned on your phone's location service (e.g., GPS). Turn on the \"location\" switch in the GNSSLogger app, as shown in the figure. Go to the next tab, \"Log\", and check whether you receive the GNSS specific diagnostic messages that include your location coordinates (latitude and longitude fix). <b>Make sure \"Fused location\" and \"Network location\" in the GNSS logger app are turned off before you start logging</b>. You can save the log data to a file and export this to the SD card or share it to your drive/email for offline use. Try playing with this app and make sure you are receiving the logs correctly. Cross-check the location coordinates reported by the app in Google maps.\n",

    "#### Guidelines for the Assignment\n",
    "Before you start working on the assignment, please read the following instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clean and well-documented code is expected. Your code should be organized in a clear and readable manner, with each task separated into its own section of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There will be no separate PDF report required. Instead, provide a detailed but to-the-point discussion in the observation section for each task. The observation section (in Markdown, Refer to [Markdown-Cheatsheet](https://github.com/lifeparticle/Markdown-Cheatsheet)) includes a clear and concise description of the task, the approach used to solve it, assumptions, and inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any extraneous information that does not address the question should be removed before submission. This will help to ensure that the answer is clear and easy to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to follow these practices will result in a penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline: $23^{nd}$, April, 2023**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Submission Instructions\n",
    "- Compress the top-level directory (ZIP format) containing this notebook with your code and the data used for the assignment. (do not remove the outputs from the notebook cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You MUST refrain from consulting your homework code with others**. Any plagiarism found in your code (or somebody who is referring to your code) will result in zero credits in this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Submissions after the deadline will not be entertained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
